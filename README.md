# 100DaysCodingChallenge
I began a 100 Days Coding Challenge on 1st October, 2020 and this repository contains my work from each day.

*<b>Day 0</b>*: Binary classification using Neural Networks (Predicting Survival of Passengers on the Titanic.)

*<b>Day 1</b>*: Naive Bayes Model for Text Classification/Prediction using Quanteda Package. (Data files included in the folder)

*<b>Day 2</b>*: Solved 5 SQL problems on Leetcode. (The links to the problems are also included in the code file) 

*<b>Day 3</b>*: Solved a problem posted on Leetcode October Challenge on 10/4/2020. 

*<b>Day 4</b>*: Created a Tableau Dashboard for MakeOverMonday Challenge 2020 week 40

*<b>Day 5</b>*: Text Sentiment Classification using Deep learning with Pytorch

*<b>Day 6</b>*: Automated Linkedin posts using Selenium and Python

*<b>Day 7</b>*: Completed the Deep learning Specialization on Coursera with the last programming assignment on sequence models. No code available.

*<b>Day 8</b>*: Pattern matching function using python(Based on a leet code problem)

*<b>Day 9</b>*: Created a code block to merge DFM with variables from the Data frame to perform complete analysis. (No code available as it is in an ongoing project)

*<b>Day 10</b>*: Studied the solution for a leetcode problem to refresh basics of python programming. (No Code available)

*<b>Day 11</b>*: Created a Tableau Dashboard for MakeOverMonday Challenge 2020 week 41

*<b>Day 12</b>*: Made progress on the Data Visualization specialization I am pursuing on Coursera. (No Code available)

*<b>Day 13</b>*: Implemented dropout using pytorch as a part of Lab in the "Big data and AI" course I am taking at school.

*<b>Day 14</b>*: Implemented a function that can find top N similar words for a given input word using Word2Vec

*<b>Day 15</b>*: Python function to concat lists of different datatypes

*<b>Day 16</b>*: Solved a problem posted on Leetcode October Challenge on 10/18/2020. No code available

*<b>Day 17</b>*: Created a Tableau Dashboard for MakeOverMonday Challenge 2020 week 42

*<b>Day 18</b>*: Developed a custom code to get a DFM in the format I needed to work on a project.(No code available as it is in an ongoing project)

*<b>Day 19</b>*: Created a Tableau Dashboard for MakeOverMonday Challenge 2020 week 44

*<b>Day 20</b>*: Created a Tableau Dashboard for a Data Visualization course I am taking on Coursera.
