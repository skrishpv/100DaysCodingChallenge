Day 6 of 100:

Guess how I made this post today! I just made one click and it was done. I automated the linkedin post using Selenium and python today. So now all I need to do is put my content in a txt file and run my python script to make a post to Linkedin. 
Selenium is a great tool when it comes to scraping and aggregating data for a project. It is also used in testing and QA. I think playing around with Selenium helps you learn a new skill to complement BeautifulSoup and also helps refresh your HTML and CSS knowledge. 
Below is my code file. I have implemented a basic post today, but the same logic can be used to add attachments and hashtags to your posts and to send automated connection requests. Give it a try!
